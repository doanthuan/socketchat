                                We are bonded and insured, and background checks are run against each person in each team we work with. This is one of the major benefits associated with using our business over an individual who may claim to take these precautions but does not.

                                Our Move In/Out cleaning is designed to prepare an apartment or house for a new tenant; there's typically more room to be vacuumed, more baseboards to be detail cleaned, more cabinet and drawer space to be cleaned, light fixtures, etc. You can select it on our booking form under 'extras'. Please keep in mind that cleaning inside the fridge and oven are separate from our regular and move out cleanings.

                                Typically it comes out to about 1 hour per bedroom for a team of 2. In the case of extremely messy homes, we recommend using the move in/out option.

                                No, you can leave a key for us to get in and we'll handle it from there. Some of our clients leave their key under a mat, in the mailbox, at a front-desk, or somewhere else out of sight. If you book online just remember to tell us where the key will be in the instructions, otherwise just give us a call.
